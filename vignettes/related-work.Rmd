## R

### [ggforce]

> Annotation is important for storytelling, and ggforce provides a family of
> geoms that makes it easy to draw attention to, and describe, features of the
> plot. They all work in the same way, but differ in the way they enclose the
> area you want to draw attention to.

### [directlabels]

> An extensible framework for automatically placing direct labels onto
> multicolor 'lattice' or 'ggplot2' plots. Label positions are described
> using Positioning Methods which can be re-used across several different
> plots. There are heuristics for examining "trellis" and "ggplot" objects
> and inferring an appropriate Positioning Method.

### [ggwordcloud]

> ggwordcloud provides a word cloud text geom for ggplot2. The placement
> algorithm implemented in C++ is an hybrid between the one of wordcloud and
> the one of wordcloud2.js. The cloud can grow according to a shape and stay
> within a mask. The size aesthetic is used either to control the font size or
> the printed area of the words. ggwordcloud also supports arbitrary text
> rotation. The faceting scheme of ggplot2 can also be used.

The `ggwordcloud` package implements a spiraling algorithm to prevent text
labels from overlapping each other.

### [wordcloud]

> Pretty word clouds.

The `wordcloud` package implements a spiraling algorithm to prevent text
labels from overlapping each other.

### [FField]

> Force field simulation of interaction of set of points. Very useful for
> placing text labels on graphs, such as scatterplots.

I found that functions in the `FField` package were not ideal for repelling
overlapping rectangles, so I wrote my own.

See [this gist][1] for examples of how to use the `wordcloud` and `FField`
packages with `ggplot2`.

### [d3fc-label-layout]

> A D3 layout that places labels avoiding overlaps, with strategies including simulated annealing, greedy and a strategy that removes overlapping labels.

[Colin Eberhardt]'s implementation for [D3] v4.

### [d3-voronoi-labels]

> A Voronoi tessellation can assist in labeling scatterplots. The area of the Voronoi cell associated with each point determines whether the point is labeled: points with larger cells tend to have room to accommodate labels.

### [An Efficient Algorithm for Scatter Chart Labeling][aaai]

Sebastian Theophil, Arno SchÃ¶dl

> This paper presents an efficient algorithm for a new variation of the point
> feature labeling problem. The goal is to position the largest number of point
> labels such that they do not intersect each other or their points. First we
> present an algorithm using a greedy algorithm with limited lookahead. We then
> present an algorithm that iteratively regroups labels, calling the first
> algorithm on each group, thereby identifying a close to optimal labeling
> order. The presented algorithm is being used in a commercial product to label
> charts, and our evaluation shows that it produces results far superior to
> those of other labeling algorithms.

This might be a good start for a revision of ggrepel.
